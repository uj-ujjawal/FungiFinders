# Build a Website from Scratch - FungiFinders

This project is a production-ready website Called **"FungiFinders"** built from scratch as part of a **two days live workshop** on [**FrontendMasters**](https://frontendmasters.com/) with **Kevin Powell**.
The workshop guided the process of designing and implementing a website step by step, covering basic web development concepts, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition to these core topics, the workshop also focused on user accessibility, best practices for writing clean and maintainable code, and organizing code for better readability. These principles were applied throughout the project to ensure the website is not only functional but also accessible and easy to maintain.

## Overview

In this project, I created a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the instructions from the workshop. The goal was to understand how each of these technologies works together to create an interactive, responsive web page.
